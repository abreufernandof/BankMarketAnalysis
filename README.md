## Which tools had I used?
1. Bank market dataset -  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing
2. Google Colaboratory Notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cEGA_VEO-PpcehvnKyJz7kqxizsXE-Mg

## What language?
Python 3

## What libraries?
Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Pandas-profiling, FancyImpute, PidotPlus, IPython, Re, Unicodedata, Google.Colab

## How this Google Colaboratory works?
1. Copy the 'Bank' directory to your Google Drive (you must have a Google account)
2. Access the homepage in https://colab.research.google.com/ 
3. Load the notebook 'Bank.ipynb' stored in /Bank/data/Bank.ipynb
4. Change the 'path_to_root' variable to match your current location
4. Be happy.

## Can I play this without Colab?
Yes. There's a plain python script inside /Bank/data/ and you may also load it in a local hosted Jupyter.
